# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
In this repository I created a model for predicting Survial of passengers in one of thw most famous shipwreks ie, Titanic.
I used the dataset from Kaggle.
I used two datasets one for training the model and other for predicting the model.

# Methodology Used
You can see that I have created  different jupter notebooks for each different tasks. This is so because, I believe all these phases of Machine Learning Predictions are very critical and we need to understand each phase of the prediction.
